# hello-world
My first repository

Hello, I'm Jonas, a 21 years old engineering student. My passion is Statistic, and with it I am planning to make a robust project. 
In sum, literature is another thing that I love. For me there is nothing more pleasant than a Asimov novel. What if, one day, I mix 
Linguistic with Statistic? What if I could create a good parse that could understand natural language? Well... That's my project.
