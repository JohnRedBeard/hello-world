# hello-world
My first repository

Hello, I'm Jonas, a 21 years old engineering student. My passion is Statistic and I am planning to make a robust project with it. 
In addition, literature is another thing that I love. What if, one day, I mix Linguistic with Statistic? What if I could create a parser that understand natural language? Well... That's my project.

Thanks for reading. Until next pull request.
